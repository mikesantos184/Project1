        Hello my name is Mayky Santos, I've been a business student at Lehman College for a long time now. I'm currently trying to finish my bachelor's degree in order to move on with my career and receive better job opportunities. I have taken regular microsoft work and excel course before, surely nothing dealing with programing. This semester i've chosen to broaden my computer skills and decided to take this CMP 128 course.
        <br>
        Here is a link to this course <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128 homepage</a>

Computer programing really intrigues me. I would love to be able to play around with the software and really get to know how to design my own website. I think it'll be really cool to look at a webpage and say "i designed this page". Like i mentioned before I'm a business student and computer programing is a completely new field for me. Therefore i'm learning something new on a weekly basis.

My three perfect jobs.. well i would say the perfect job would be one that is stable with a decent income and ofcourse a pension. With these requisites I would enjoy working any job as long as it's morally ethical.

</ul>

    One of my favorite movies of all time is THE DEPARTED. I just really enjoy watching this movie, even when it's sensored on TV. I can't help myself but to sit re-watch scenes, and memorize quotes. True classic starting Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Truly a must watch.
